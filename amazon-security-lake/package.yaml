  [Amazon Security Lake](https://aws.amazon.com/security-lake/) automatically
  centralizes security data from cloud, on-premises, and custom sources.

  This package provides pipelines for writing OCSF events to Amazon Security
  Lake using the S3-based ingestion format.

  *NOTE*: Before you can write events to the Security Lake, you must configure
  a *custom source* per event type in Security Lake and ensure the Tenzir Node
  has write permissions to the S3 bucket in the respective source directory. The
  package assumes that you adhere to the Tenzir naming scheme `tnz-ocsf-XXXX` where
  `XXXX` is the class UID of an OCSF event class.
