      Forwards all events arriving on the topic `slack` to Slack.

      // Slack requires every message to arrive in a JSON body in the format
      // `{text: "<message>"}`. To achieve that, we just write the content out
      // line by line and then read it back in, which gives us a human-readable
      // dump of the events in Slack, no matter what form they were in before.
