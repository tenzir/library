  The [Slack](https://slack.com) package makes it easy to send data from a
  pipeline to a Slack channel using incoming webhooks, enabling real-time
  security alerts and notifications. Configure the package with your Slack app's
  webhook URL to automatically forward critical events, detection results, or
  aggregated metrics directly to your team's communication channels. This
  integration supports custom message formatting and allows security teams to
  stay informed about important events without leaving their collaboration
  workspace.

      // Slack requires every message to arrive in a JSON body in the format
      // `{text: "<message>"}`. To achieve that, we just write the content out
      // line by line and then read it back in, which gives us a human-readable
      // dump of the events in Slack, no matter what form they were in before.
