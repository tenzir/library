  This package imports a pre-recorded data set from the M57-Patents company, a
  forensics research corpus generated by Woods at al. in 2001. The original
  packet captures were run through Suricata and Zeek, creating an example data
  set for Tenzir's demo nodes on app.tenzir.com.

      The `taste` operator returns up to the specified number of events per
      schema. We use it to show some of all Zeek TSV logs to get an idea of our
      dataset.

      | where #schema == "zeek.conn"
      | where :ip in 10.10.5.0/25
      | where orig_bytes > 1 Mi or duration > 30 min

  - name: Identify top hitters
