description: |
  This package provides sample data and example pipelines to play with. Every
  cloud-hosted demo node has this package installed by default.

  The package imports a Zeek and Suricata logs that run on a PCAP from a
  modified version of the M57-Patents dataset, a forensics research corpus
  generated by Woods at al. in 2001. We enhanced this PCAP by also injecting
  traffic from malware samples.
